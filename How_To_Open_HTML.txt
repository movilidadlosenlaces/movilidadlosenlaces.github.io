How to open the HTML Download.

If you decompress the contents of the .zip file and open the genially.html, you will be able to see your genially in the browser, even with no internet connection.
We should note that not having internet connection you mean that you may not be able to see external content, like videos, social media, etc.

If you have any question, please contact us in support@genial.ly.
